# What is Bimble exactly?

**Bimble (BB)** is an innovative programming language designed to combine the speed and efficiency of Rust with the simplicity and readability akin to Python, all while embracing the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, similar to Java. This means that Bimble code can be written on any platform and executed on various systems without modification.

**Key Features and Design Philosophy:**

1. **Performance and Efficiency:** Bimble aims to harness the performance benefits of Rust, known for its speed and memory safety.
2. **Simplicity and Readability:** Drawing inspiration from Python, Bimble prioritizes readability and ease of use. It adopts a clean and intuitive syntax that minimizes boilerplate code and facilitates rapid development.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Like Java's WORA principle, Bimble code is compiled into an executable format (.bxe file) using the Bimble Generator (BG). The Bimble Virtual Machine (BVM) then interprets and executes this file, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems and architectures.
4. **BVM Execution Model:** The BVM processes the .bxe file, initializes necessary data structures, and starts execution from the designated `main` function. This approach abstracts away platform-specific details, providing a consistent runtime environment for Bimble programs.
5. **Modularity and Extensibility:** Bimble encourages modular programming practices, allowing developers to organize code into reusable components (functions, modules, and libraries). This fosters code maintainability and scalability.
6. **Community and Ecosystem:** With an emphasis on developer community engagement, Bimble supports a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools. This enables developers to leverage existing solutions and contribute to the language's evolution.
7. **Tooling and Development Support:** Bimble provides robust tooling, including compilers, debuggers, and profiling tools, tailored to streamline development workflows. This comprehensive support ecosystem enhances developer productivity and code quality.

In essence, Bimble bridges the gap between performance-driven systems programming and developer-friendly application development, offering a versatile solution for a wide spectrum of software projects. By embracing the strengths of Rust and Python while adhering to the principles of platform independence, Bimble aims to empower developers to write efficient and portable code effortlessly.
